Expression elements are the building blocks of dbExpression enabling fluent query composition, *they are fundamental to building queries*.
Elements are dbExpression's type system, where the element types are used to help determine the return type(s) of queries, constrain 
allowed parameters with database functions, and constrain/adapt the composition of one or more elements into composite elements.
