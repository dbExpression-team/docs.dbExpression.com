title: Types of Filter Expressions
---

dbExpression supports combining individual expression elements and literal values to create new composite expressions.  The composition of expression elements into filter expressions are used 
to limit the data affected/returned from query execution. These expressions generally fall into one of three categories:
* Comparison Expressions
* Logical Expressions
* Filter Expressions
