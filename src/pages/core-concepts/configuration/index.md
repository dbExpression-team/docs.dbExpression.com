The configuration you provide to dbExpression falls into one of two categories:
* **Scaffolding Configuration** - Configuration you provide in the *dbex.config.json* file that effects the code-generated model of your database.
Use scaffolding configuration to change the static model of your database.
* **Runtime Configuration** - Configuration you provide in C# in the startup of your application that affects the behaviour of dbExpression as your
application is running.
